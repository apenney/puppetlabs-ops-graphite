# Hackerty graphite.

Due to https://twitter.com/puppetlabs/status/237650034261364736 we thought
we'd share what we have of our graphite module, which will either be
useful, or slow you down.

This might (okay does) require modules that aren't released. Avoid those
bits.

It probably only works on Debian 5, it doesn't use packages, I guess it's
released under the MIT licence. If you can make it work for you and it's
useful, please do!
